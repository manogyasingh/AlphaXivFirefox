# AlphaXiv for arXiv

**AlphaXiv for arXiv** is a Firefox extension that enhances the [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) experience by adding a "View on AlphaXiv" link in the "Access Paper" section of each paper's abstract page. This makes it easier to access the AlphaXiv forum for any arXiv paper.

## How to Install

### Installing from the Firefox Add-ons Store

1. Visit the [AlphaXiv for arXiv](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/alphaxiv-for-arxiv/) page on the Firefox Add-ons Store.
2. Click on **"Add to Firefox"**.
3. Follow the prompts to install the extension.
4. Once installed, navigate to any [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) paper to see the "View on AlphaXiv" link in the "Access Paper" section.

### Installing Manually for Testing

If you wish to test the extension manually just clone the repo and then:

1. **Open Firefox and Access `about:debugging`:**

   - Type `about:debugging` in the address bar and press **Enter**.
   - Click on **"This Firefox"** in the left sidebar.

2. **Load Temporary Add-on:**

   - Click on **"Load Temporary Add-on"**.
   - Select the `manifest.json` file from the cloned repository directory.

3. **Test the Extension:**

   - Navigate to an arXiv paper page, e.g., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).
   - Verify the "View on AlphaXiv" link appears in the "Access Paper" section.

## Contributing

If it becomes outdated due to a Firefox update and someone wants to help fix it that would be really cool. Otherwise this is a very simple tool and I don't intend to make it any more functional than the original [AlphaXiv Chrome Extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/alphaxiv-open-research-di/liihfcjialakefgidmaadhajjikbjjab)
If you do, just fork this and do whatever you want.
